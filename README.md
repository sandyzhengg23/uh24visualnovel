# uh24visualnovel

Me, along with two other people, used renpy and visual studio code to create this visual novel. Though, it's unfinished we made a lot of progress. 

main code in script.rpy
gui.rpy, options.rpy, and screens.rpy are all default from the app renpy. 

used renpy to launch the files and used visual studio code as text editor
